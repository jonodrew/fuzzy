# Fuzzy Labs Tech Test

## Setting up
This project uses `poetry` for package management. Once you've installed it, you can use `poetry install` to get all
your dependencies.

This is pure python with the FastAPI framework for ease of development. Because it's FastAPI, the docs for the API
can be found at `localhost:8000/docs` once you've got it up and running. Getting it running should be as simple as
changing directory (`cd`) into the `tech_test` directory and running `fastapi run`.

There's no infrastructure yet - it'll
probably be docker or similar.
